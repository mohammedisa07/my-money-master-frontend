MONEY MASTER - PERSONAL FINANCE TRACKER

PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
Money Master is a modern, intuitive web application designed to make personal finance management effortless. 
Users can easily record income and expenditures, categorize transactions (e.g., Food, Fuel, Medical), and switch between Personal and Office divisions. 
The application features a real-time dashboard with month-wise, weekly, and yearly spending analytics, a transaction history tracker, and strict rules for editing transactions (limited to a 12-hour window). 
It also includes robust account management, allowing users to track balances and transfers between multiple accounts.
